## 🎨 Design Features

### Dark Theme Mermaid Diagrams

All diagrams use consistent dark theme styling:

```javascript
%%{init: {'theme':'dark', 'themeVariables': { 
  'primaryColor':'#1e1e1e',
  'primaryTextColor':'#fff',
  'primaryBorderColor':'#4a9eff'
}}}%%
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🔵 Blue - Input/External systems
- 🟢 Green - AI/Processing layers
- 🟣 Purple - Output/Results
- 🔴 Red - Infrastructure/Storage
- 🟠 Orange - Compute resources

### GitHub Compatible

All Mermaid diagrams have been tested and render correctly on:
- ✅ GitHub web interface
- ✅ GitHub mobile app
- ✅ VS Code preview
- ✅ Markdown viewers
