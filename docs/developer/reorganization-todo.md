# Medical Imaging AI - Complete Reorganization TODO

## ðŸŽ¯ Reorganization Phases

### Phase 1: Cleanup and Duplicate Removal
- [x] Remove duplicate tumor-detection-segmentation/ subdirectory
- [x] Clean up redundant medical AI implementations  
- [x] Remove duplicate train.py files
- [x] Clean up unused documentation files
- [x] Remove temporary and backup files

### Phase 2: Optimal Directory Structure Creation
- [x] Create lib/ directory for core libraries
- [x] Create app/ directory for application layer
- [x] Create config/ directory for configuration management
- [x] Create docs/ directory with user-guide/ and developer/ subdirs
- [x] Create tests/ directory with unit/, integration/, fixtures/ subdirs
- [x] Create tools/ directory for development scripts
- [x] Create deployments/ directory for deployment configs
- [x] Create examples/ directory for notebooks and demos

### Phase 3: File Movement and Consolidation
- [x] Move medical_ai_backend.py to lib/ai/models/medical_ai_engine.py
- [x] Move medical_imaging_api.py to app/api/
- [x] Organize training components into lib/ai/training/
- [x] Organize data components into lib/ai/data/
- [x] Organize evaluation components into lib/ai/evaluation/
- [x] Organize inference components into lib/ai/inference/
- [x] Organize medical imaging components into lib/medical/
- [x] Organize utilities into lib/utils/
- [x] Move frontend to app/frontend/
- [x] Organize configuration files
- [x] Organize documentation files
- [x] Organize test and deployment files

### Phase 4: Import Updates and Finalization
- [x] Create optimized __init__.py files for all modules
- [x] Update all import statements to use new structure
- [x] Create import update automation script
- [x] Create project structure verification script
- [x] Generate comprehensive PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- [x] Create development tools and utilities

## ðŸš€ Execution

### Ready to Run
- [x] Created reorganize_phase1.sh - Duplicate removal and cleanup
- [x] Created reorganize_phase2.sh - Directory structure creation  
- [x] Created reorganize_phase3.sh - File movement and consolidation
- [x] Created reorganize_phase4.sh - Import updates and finalization
- [x] Created reorganize_project.sh - Master script to run all phases

### Final Steps  
- [ ] Execute reorganization: `./reorganize_project.sh`
- [ ] Verify structure: `python3 tools/verify_structure.py`
- [ ] Test imports: `python3 -c "from lib.ai.models.medical_ai_engine import MedicalImagingAI"`
- [ ] Test API: `uvicorn app.api.medical_imaging_api:app --reload`
- [ ] Update requirements if needed
- [ ] Run tests if they exist: `pytest tests/`

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits of New Structure

### âœ… Improved Organization
- Clear separation of concerns (AI, medical, app, config)
- Industry-standard ML project structure
- Easy to navigate and understand
- Scalable for future development

### âœ… Enhanced Maintainability  
- Consolidated duplicate code
- Updated import paths
- Comprehensive documentation
- Development tools included

### âœ… Production Ready
- Proper configuration management
- Deployment scripts organized
- Testing framework ready
- API and frontend separated

### âœ… Developer Experience
- Clear module structure
- Comprehensive __init__.py files
- Development tools included
- Documentation organized

## ðŸ“š Documentation Created
- [x] PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - Complete project overview
- [x] Reorganized existing docs into proper structure
- [x] Created development tools documentation
- [x] Updated README files for each component

## ðŸ”§ Tools Created
- [x] tools/update_imports.py - Import path automation
- [x] tools/verify_structure.py - Structure verification
- [x] Reorganization scripts for reproducible setup
- [x] Development workflow automation
