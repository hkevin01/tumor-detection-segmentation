- `Makefile` (standard build file)
- `pyproject.toml` (Python package configuration)
- `setup.py` (Python package setup)
- Configuration files (`.gitignore`, `.env`, etc.)
- Standard directories (`src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, etc.)

## Total Files Moved: 11/11 ✅

All requested files have been successfully **moved** (not copied) to their appropriate subdirectories, keeping the root folder clean and organized as requested.

## Created Directories:
- `scripts/training/` (for training-related scripts)
- `scripts/monitoring/` (for monitoring scripts)
- `scripts/testing/` (for test scripts)
- `tests/utils/` (for utility tests)
- `tests/training/` (for training tests)
- `docs/implementation/` (for implementation documentation)
- `docs/reports/` (for reports)
- `docs/planning/` (for planning documents)

The root directory is now clean with only essential configuration files and README.md remaining.
